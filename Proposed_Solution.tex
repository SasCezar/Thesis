\section{Pipeline}
Introduction of the pipeline
\subsection{Preprocessing}
Preprocessing\\
Query expansion
\subsection{Candidate Generation}
Wiki2Vec training \\
How the model is used for the candidate generation
\subsection{Candidate Ranking}
How the candidates are ranked from the model + disambiguation \& popularity
\subsection{NIL Prediction}
This model is good for the NIL detection based on the assumption that if the entity mention is not in model then it is not part of the domain.
